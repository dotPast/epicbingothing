## Build Dependencies
[Origami](https://github.com/AsoDesu/Origami) is not available through Maven repositories or JitPack, so a local `.jar` build is used.  
Build the `engine` dependency and move the build artifact to `libs/origami.engine.jar`. (If your build fails, make sure you are not using Java 8.)  

Rest of the required libraries are using Maven repositories or JitPack.
